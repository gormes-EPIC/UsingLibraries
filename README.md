# Lab 0: Using Libraries
## Java
Install and add the [Apache Commons Library](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/download_lang.cgi) to a new Java project.
Install and add the [Guava Library](https://github.com/google/guava) to the same Java project.
### Send an Email
1. Send me an email at gormes@lps.k12.co.us using the [Apache Commons Email](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-email/index.html) module.
2. Include an image and your `.java` file as an attachments on the email.
3. The user guide on the Email module gives a straightforward template to do this.
4. For an additional challenge, format your email using HTML
### Extract Metadata
1. Read in the image `image.jpg` using the [Adobe Commons Imaging](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-imaging/index.html) module.
2. Create a text file with all of the Exif metadata from the image.
3. Write new metadata from the image so the image was taken here at EPIC Campus.
4. Upload your new image and your text file
### Ordering a List
1. Use [Guava's Ordering](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/OrderingExplained) to order `input.txt` alphabetically and in ASCII code order.
2. Output both your ordered lists to `alphabetical.txt` and `ascii.txt`

### Choose Your Own Adventure
1. Choose one other module from either Apache Commons or Guava. 
2. Create a Java program to demonstrate the basic functionality of the module.
3. You will present this module to the rest of the class

----
## Python
The email package is already included in Python's Standard Library. [Here is the documentation.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.examples.html)
You will need to install and use the [exif](https://pypi.org/project/exif/) module. 
### Send an Email
1. Send me an email at gormes@lps.k12.co.us using the email module.
2. Include an image and your `.py` file as an attachments on the email.
3. The user guide on the Email module gives a straightforward template to do this.
4. For an additional challenge, format your email using HTML

2. Output both your ordered lists to `alphabetical.txt` and `ascii.txt`
### Choose Your Own Adventure
1. Choose one other module from the package index
2. Create a Python program to demonstrate the basic functionality of the module.
3. You will present this module to the rest of the class
### Rubric
4 points - Complete repository including images and outputted text files. Code should have in-line comments to explain your thinking but you do not need do Javadoc comments.
3 points - Some components as described above are missing. Code may be present, but is uncommented, etc.
2 points - Incomplete or missing.

### Extra Credit
up to 4 points - For extra credit you can complete the same assignment in a second language.Partial credit will be awarded for attempting, but not completing the other assignment.
