# Lab 0: Using Libraries
## Java
Install and add the [Apache Commons Library](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/download_lang.cgi) to a new Java project.
Install and add the [Guava Library](https://github.com/google/guava) to the same Java project.
### Send an Email
1. Send me an email at gormes@lps.k12.co.us using the [Apache Commons Email](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-email/index.html) module.
2. Include an image and your `.java` file as an attachments on the email.
3. The user guide on the Email module gives a straightforward template to do this.
4. For an additional challenge, format your email using HTML
### Extract Metadata
1. Read in the image `image.jpg` using the [Adobe Commons Imaging](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-imaging/index.html) module.
2. Create a text file with all of the Exif metadata from the image.
3. Write new metadata from the image so the image was taken here at EPIC Campus.
4. Upload your new image and your text file
### Ordering a List
1. Use [Guava's Ordering](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/OrderingExplained) to order `input.txt` alphabetically and in ASCII code order.
2. Output both your ordered lists to `alphabetical.txt` and `ascii.txt`

### Choose Your Own Adventure
1. Choose one other module from either Apache Commons or Guava. 
2. Create a Java program to demonstrate the basic functionality of the module.
3. You will present this module to the rest of the class

## Python
The email package is already included in Python's Standard Library. [Here is the documentation.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.examples.html)
You will need to install and use the [exif](https://pypi.org/project/exif/) module. 
### Send an Email
1. Send me an email at gormes@lps.k12.co.us using the email module.
